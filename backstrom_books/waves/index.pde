Waves by Finite Element Analysis

This book, which is a sequel to "Fields of Physics by FEA, An Introduction", illustrates 
electrodynamics and wave mechanics by FEA, exploiting the convenient features of 
FlexPDE.  In order to profit from this approach to the understanding of fields you should 
type the problem descriptors yourself, run them, modify them, and consider how the results 
compare and connect to theory. The files included are a selection of examples from the book, 
which you can run directly and even modify by trying different values in the DEFINITIONS 
section. Those examples will provide the flavor of the book. You can also solve problems 
of your own, but the number of nodes will be restricted.
