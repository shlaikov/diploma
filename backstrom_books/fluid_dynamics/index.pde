This is the fourth volume of the series on the practical use of finite element analysis in physics. It exploits the convenient features of FlexPDE for solving problems concerning irrotational flow, even with circulation, viscous flow in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, both in the limit of low Reynolds number and for Re>>1. In order to profit fully from this approach to the understanding of fluid dynamics you should type the problem descriptors yourself, run them, modify them, and consider how the results compare with theory. The files included are a selection of examples from the book, which you can run directly, and even modify by trying different values in the Definitions section. You can also write your own problem descriptors, but the number of nodes will then be restricted.
