Fields of Physics by Finite Element Analysis, An Introduction

This book, which so far is unique in the world literature, illustrates 
various fields of physics by FEA, exploiting the convenient features of 
FlexPDE.  In order to profit from this approach to the understanding of 
fields you should type the problem descriptors yourself, run them, modify 
them, and consider how the results compare and connect to theory. The 
diskette comprises the program and a selection of examples from the book, 
which you can run directly and even modify by trying different values in 
the Definitions section. Those examples will provide the flavor of the book.
You can also solve problems of your own, but the number of nodes will be 
restricted.
